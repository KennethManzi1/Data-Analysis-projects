## Problem
Are you a Python programmer that uses ChatGPT but don't want to go on the OpenAI website to paste your code there as you want another way for the AI can give you feedback???? Do you want access to ChatGPT directly on your Jupyter Notebook file??? 

Well look no further as you can actually create your own ChatGPT program where the AI will answer your questions automatically whether you are writing your script in an IDE such as Visual Studio Code or on a Open Document Format such as Jupyter notebook.

There are three ways to accomplish this and I will go through each method as each are uniquely different and provide different alternatives of activating ChatGPT on your program and giving you the best value possible on optimizing your python scripts in order to create the solutions that you need to bring value to your peers.

## Solution 1

Here is the first way to do it and this is where you'll need an open AI account because you'll need to generate an API Key which you'll need to run the script. Make sure you use pip install openAI if you don't have the library in your python

```Python
pip install openai 
from openai import OpenAI
```

To get the Open AI API key. I'll walk you through on my screen on how to get it. You can create an Open AI account and get API Key on the Open AI website [here](https://platform.openai.com/)

Please be aware that you'll get free usage on a certain limit and if you go over the limit(meaning if you run the code too many times and it exceeds the limit) you'll get the message that you exceeded the limit and may have to wait until the limit resets or will need to pay to increase the limit usage.
