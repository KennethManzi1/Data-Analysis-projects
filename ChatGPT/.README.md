## Problem
Are you a Python programmer that uses ChatGPT but don't want to go on the OpenAI website to paste your code there as you want another way for the AI can give you feedback???? Do you want access to ChatGPT directly on your Jupyter Notebook file??? 

Well look no further as you can actually create your own ChatGPT program where the AI will answer your questions automatically whether you are writing your script in an IDE such as Visual Studio Code or on a Open Document Format such as Jupyter notebook.

There are three ways to accomplish this and I will go through each method as each are uniquely different and provide different alternatives of activating ChatGPT on your program and giving you the best value possible on optimizing your python scripts in order to create the solutions that you need to bring value to your peers.
